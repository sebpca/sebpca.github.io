        	<h1>About me,</h1>
		<p>My name is <i>S&eacute;bastien Pesseat</i>, and I am a French expert in HTML/CSS/Photoshop. I love mixing web development and web design, mocking up pixel-perfect design into pixel-perfect code. I have listed some key facts that would describe me in a not-too-boring way, hopefully.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      My first interest was Biology and I was planning to do some research.
      </li>
       <li>
      I started to work quite early doing websites, as the demand was huge and I was just finishing my studies. I was only 24 years old.
      </li>
      <li>
      My first website was for an Architect in Nice, during an internship, but I never get paid.
      </li>
      <li>
      Dreamweaver is the first tool I ever used to build website and Netscape was my first browsing nightmare.
      </li>
      <li>
      I have been working 16 years remotely for international companies, 7 years in Italy (FAO) and 9 years in UK (EBI).
      </li>
      <li>
      I did build a disease mapping tool to help and alert research on disease outbreaks (FAO), while you had the Swine Influenza spreading across the world.
      </li>
